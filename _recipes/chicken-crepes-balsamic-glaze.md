## Marinade
1. Start by marinating the chicken. Pat the chicken dry with a paper towel. Combine the soy sauce, worcestershire sauce, pepper, garlic powder, 3 tablespoons of olive oil and 2 teaspoons of balsamic vinegar into a ziploc or container with your chicken.

2. Seal the ziploc and shake it around to make sure the chicken is properly covered. Marinate for at least 1 hour, ideally a couple of hours.

## Crepe Batter
3. After you've made the marinade, make the crepe batter. Combine the egg, flour, milk, water, salt and melted butter in a stand mixer or blender. Mixing by hand is fine too. The butter should be in liquid form.

4. Put the well blended version in the fridge for at least 30 minutes before cooking, ideally longer.

## Spinach Pesto
5. Combine the spinach, minced garlic, pine nuts, 1/4 cup shredded parmesan, 1/4 cup of olive oil, juice from 1/2 a lemon, salt and pepper into a blender or food processor.

6. Blend or pulse until you get a nice pesto consistency. Add salt and pepper to taste.

## Balsamic Glaze
7. Combine the sugar and the half cup of balsamic vinegar together in a pot and place it on medium/low heat on the stove top. Stir occasionally at the beginning to help the sugar dissolve.

8. You want the liquid to be bubbling slightly. After 15-20 minutes, the glaze will have thickened and only half the liquid will still be in the pot.

## Cook the Chicken
9. While the glaze reduces, cook the chicken. For tenders, grill them on the stove top, about 6 minutes on each side. If you're using thighs or breasts, you can bake them.

10. Let the chicken rest after cooking, then slice the meat before starting the crepes.

## Make the Crepes
11. Take the batter out of the fridge. You'll likely need to add more milk because some of the liquid will have evaporated. You want a consistency of heavy cream, so whisk or stir in more milk until you have that.

12. Heat a 10 inch non stick round pan to medium heat. Take a stick of butter and rub it quickly around the whole pan.

13. Use a ladle to add a thin layer of batter on the pan, quickly swirling the pan to coat it evenly.

14. Cook the crepe for around a minute or so before flipping. You want the edges to start firming up and browning and the color of the crepe batter to change and become darker and more opaque.

15. Once you've flipped the crepe, add the shredded mozzarella to the center of the crepe. Be generous! Then add a couple dollops of the pesto, layering some pieces of chicken on top.

16. Add some balsamic glaze, like you would add a very light layer of syrup to pancakes.

17. Fold the crepe in half, still in the pan, then move it to a plate.

18. Once on the plate, add some more pesto to the top and sprinkle some glaze lightly. Add a pesto smear if you're trying to impress and then sprinkle some parmesan shavings around the plate. Voila!
