1. Begin by making the batter. Combine the eggs, milk, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt together. I like to use an immersion blender, but you can use a regular blender or combine by hand.

2. Pour the batter into a square tray or flat dish that can accommodate one or two pieces of bread. You want this dish to be flat, otherwise the bread won't be able to soak up all the batter and you'll waste some. You'll also cause the drenched bread to potentially break if the pieces aren't lying flat.

3. Soak the bread for around a minute on each side.

4. Heat up a non stick pan to medium heat. Add some canola oil to the pan. It's very important you use canola or vegetable oil as you want an oil that has a high burning point. Do not use butter or olive oil.

5. After you've added some oil to the pan, use a spatula to place the pieces of brioche into the pan. You'll want to cook on medium heat (maybe slightly lower depending on your stove) for around 2 minutes on each side. You want a nice golden brown exterior.

6. While your brioche is cooking, slice up some strawberries, making sure they are as thin as possible.

7. After cutting the strawberries, whip up the cream, adding the vanilla near the end. If you want to take a healthier route, vanilla greek yogurt pairs very well.

8. To serve, place some whipped cream, strawberries and maple syrup on top of a nice warm piece of french toast. Enjoy!
