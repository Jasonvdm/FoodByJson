1. Get a large pot out. Heat up some olive oil at medium-low and add your vegetables, ginger, and garlic. Get the veggies a little brown or soft on the outside, you want to see some color.

2. Add the vinegar, cook for another two minutes.

3. Then add the broth. The amount of broth should just cover the vegetables, about half an inch of coverage.

4. Add all the spices, including salt and pepper.

5. Bring to a simmer and let the veggies simmer for about 25 minutes. Occasionally stir to make sure nothing is sticking or burning. You want the vegetables to become pretty soft.

6. Take off the heat and use a ladle to transfer to the food processor. You may have to do this in batches. Blend until quite smooth. If the result is too thick, you can add some more water here.

7. Pour the blended result back into the pot.

8. Add the coconut cream.

9. Taste! Adjust as needed. Ginger should give a little hint of spice, if it's lacking this, add some ground ginger. The curry powder should introduce an earthiness. If the flavors aren't popping, you need more salt. You can almost always add more salt and pepper.

10. You want the soup to be thicker than a broth soup, but thinner than baby food. You can always add more milk to thin it out.
