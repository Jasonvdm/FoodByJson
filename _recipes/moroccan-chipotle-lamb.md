This is a fun dish! There is a massive Middle Eastern influence on Mexican food (al pastor for instance) so I thought I would switch it around and add a Mexican flare to a Moroccan dish. This lamb combines Moroccan flavors with chipotles soaked in adobo sauce, for a smoky, spicy but full bodied flavor profile.

## Marinate the Lamb

1. Start by patting the shanks dry. Then add a liberal amount of cumin, white and black pepper, paprika, onion powder, oregano and salt to the shanks. You want a good amount of each! Go more than less.

2. Add the shanks to a ziploc bag and then add a liberal amount of olive oil to the shanks. Crush around 6 cloves of garlic with the side of a knife and add those too.

3. Finally, add two tablespoons of adobo sauce from the can of chipotles, and 3 chipotles to the bag. Go less if you don't like spicy food, more if you like very spicy food.

4. Seal the ziploc and then make sure all the liquid spreads nicely and coats the shanks. Now put it in the fridge for at least 2 hours.

## Cook the Lamb

5. Cut the onion and carrots into large chunks. If you have baby carrots, no need to cut anything.

6. Get a large pot out that is oven proof and place it on the stove top at a high setting. Add some olive oil or grapeseed oil and sear the lamb shanks until each side has a nice crust and color on it.

7. Remove the lamb shanks and place to the side. Turn down the pot to medium and let it cool for a minute or so.

8. Now add two tablespoons of minced garlic. Cook the garlic for two minutes and then add the carrots and onions.

9. After a few minutes, add two tablespoons of the red wine vinegar if you have it then cook for another 2 minutes.

10. Now place the lamb shanks back in the pot, so they are resting on top of the carrots and onions.

11. Add the bottle of wine! Get the liquid to boil and simmer for about 10-15 minutes - you want the liquid to reduce by about half.

12. The last step is to add the chicken or beef stock. Put the whole pot into the oven at 325°F for 3 hours!

13. Check periodically and turn the shanks and baste the liquid over any exposed pieces. At around 30 minutes to go, add the mushrooms.

## To Serve

14. Serve the lamb shanks with the bone. I like to make mashed potatoes and then make a gravy from some of the sauce from the pot.

15. If you cut the carrots large enough, they'll be a nice texture by this point as well. Enjoy!
