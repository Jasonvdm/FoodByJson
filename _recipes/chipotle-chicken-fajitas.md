## Marinate the Chicken
1. Start by marinating the chicken. Combine the lime juice, worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, garlic powder, olive oil and 2 tablespoons of adobo sauce from your can of chipotle peppers.

2. Pat the chicken dry and season with salt and pepper. Be generous with the pepper. Place the chicken in a ziploc bag or bowl and add the marinade. Throw the chicken in the fridge for at least a few hours.

## Cook the Chicken
3. After marinating is done, save the marinade for later! If using chicken breast, cook in the oven. If using chicken tenders, cook them in a skillet on the stove top, about 5 minutes on each side. Turn the heat up high to get a nice sear.

4. Once the chicken has cooked, let it rest for ten minutes then chop it up into nice large chunks.

## Prepare the Vegetables
5. While the chicken cooks, cut the bell peppers in strips and the onions in half rings (and decently thick). Also dice up two or three chipotles and about a tablespoon of fresh oregano leaves. Use three chipotles if you like spice, one or two if you don't.

6. Heat up a large pan or skillet, then add olive oil and the minced garlic (about a tablespoon). After a minute, add the onions and cook for a few more minutes until the onions change color and become very yellow.

7. Add the bell peppers and any other veggies. Add the chipotles, the saved marinade, the oregano, and the drained can of fire roasted tomatoes.

8. Let the veggies cook for around 10 minutes on medium heat, stirring occasionally. At minute 8 of the ten, add the chicken you cooked earlier.

## Make the Guacamole
9. While you're cooking the veggies, prepare your guac! Mash up your avocados, add salt (be generous and taste!), pepper, garlic salt (1 teaspoon) and half an onion (diced).

10. Squeeze some fresh lime juice to taste, and your guac is ready! If you want to really take your guac to the next level, add a half teaspoon of cumin - it adds an earthiness that is delicious. Also try to use himalayan salt.

## To Serve
11. Serve the fajitas nice and hot with some salsa, sour cream, lime wedges and your guacamole. Buen provecho!
