1. Fill up a pot with water and some salt and begin heating it up. Make sure the pot is large enough for the pasta.

2. Heat up the garlic and some olive oil in a large skillet for a minute.

3. Add the pancetta, render down the fat and allow the pancetta to brown a little. Then add the mushrooms, the vinegar and a lot of black pepper, around 2 teaspoons. Cook for about 3-5 minutes - the mushrooms should shrink and become soft.

4. Add the broth, cook for about 5-7 minutes until liquid is about half its original volume. You want the broth simmering energetically the whole time.

5. Add the cup of cream to the broth and also put the pasta in the pot to cook. When your pasta is done, your sauce is done. Cook for 8-10 minutes.

6. Stir and taste. Add more salt and pepper and vinegar if you think it needs it. If you used pancetta, you won't need any additional salt. You will likely need to add a little more pepper.

7. To serve, drain the pasta and put about 3/4 of the pasta inside the pan and stir with the sauce.

8. To be fancy, add chopped parsley on the top.
