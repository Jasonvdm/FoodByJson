1. Start by making the marinade. Combine 1/4 cup of olive oil, soy sauce, worcestershire sauce, red wine vinegar and 2 tablespoons of lime juice together. Give it a nice stir.

2. Pat the skirt steak dry with a paper towel. Then apply a liberal amount of salt, pepper, white pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika and oregano on the meat. Also add cayenne pepper but go light, it's spicy!

3. Once you've done this, place the steak and the marinade into a ziploc bag and marinate in the fridge for a few hours or overnight.

4. Before cooking the steak, make sure you take it out of the fridge for at least 30 minutes so that it gets to room temperature.

5. When you're ready to cook the steak, make sure you pat it dry with a paper towel. The dryer the surface of the steak, the better the sear you will get.

6. While you're doing this, have a cast iron skillet (or something similar) heating up on the stove top. You want it as hot as it can go - but don't put oil in yet.

7. When you're ready to cook, add some olive or grape seed oil to the pan and immediately put the steak down. Cook on high heat for 2 minutes on each side. This steak cooks fast!

8. Once you're done, remove the steak and let it rest for 5 or so minutes on a cutting board before slicing.
