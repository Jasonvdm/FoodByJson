## Rice
1. Start by rinsing the rice thoroughly. If you have a rice cooker or instant pot, use that. If you're using a stove top to cook the rice, Google for directions.

2. Add the coconut milk and water to the rice, with a good pinch of salt. Add half the ginger (½ tablespoon). Cook as directed by the appropriate method. I prefer the instant pot, 5 minutes on high pressure, 10 minutes of natural release.

## Carrots
3. While you're cooking the rice, cut the carrots. Heat up a non stick pan to medium heat with a little olive oil and add the rest of the ginger and the garlic.

4. Sweat the garlic and ginger for about a minute and then add the carrots. You're going to cook the carrots for about twenty minutes.

5. After about five minutes, add the rice wine vinegar. After fifteen minutes total, add the honey and lower the heat a little. You want the carrots to get a little brown, but not too mushy.

## Salmon
6. Pat the salmon dry with paper towel and season both sides with salt and pepper - be generous. Heat up a non stick skillet to medium high and add some olive oil.

7. Place the fish skin side down first. You want to hear a sizzle when you add the salmon. The salmon won't take very long, between 8 and 12 minutes.

8. Cook the salmon on skin side for about 5 to 7 minutes, the goal is to start to get the skin crispy. After that time has elapsed, flip the salmon to the non skin side and just briefly (30 seconds) cook to get some color.

9. Flip back over, and cook at a lower heat for an additional 3-4 minutes. Immediately once you've flipped the salmon, add a knob of butter in the pan and once the butter has melted, spoon the oil over the salmon, basting it.

## Avocado Puree
10. Combine the avocado, coconut cream, red pepper flakes, lime juice and 1 tablespoon of olive oil into a blender or food processor.

11. Add a healthy pinch of salt and pepper. Turn on the processor until the puree is smooth - pause to scrape the sides. Taste and add salt/pepper if needed. You want the puree to be slightly salty.

## To Serve
12. Add a large blob of the puree on the plate and use the back of a dessert spoon to smear the puree in a teardrop shape.

13. Place some carrots on one side, coconut rice on the other, and place the salmon on top of the rice.

14. Spoon any extra juice from the salmon pan on top of the salmon and rice.
