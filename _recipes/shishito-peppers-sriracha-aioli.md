1. Begin by making the aioli. Combine the mayo, sriracha, sweet thai chili sauce, juice from the lemon, and garlic. Mix well and then put in the fridge.

2. You want to chill the aioli for at least an hour. This will help remove the sharpness of the raw garlic.

3. Cooking the shishito peppers is pretty simple. Heat a skillet or pan (cast iron is best) to very high heat.

4. After a minute of pre-heating, add a little olive oil to the pan. Add your peppers.

5. Turn them when they get some nice dark brown color on the one side. This won't take very long, maybe two minutes on each side.

6. Once both sides have some color, remove them.

7. Plate the peppers, and salt and pepper them liberally.

8. Serve with the aioli!
